<h2>Poem from the book <i>Milk and Honey</i> authored by Rupi Kaur</h2>
<hr/>

<p>your art<br/>
is not about how many people<br/>
like your work<br/>
your art<br/>
is about<br/>
if your heart likes your work<br/>
if your soul likes your work<br/>
it's about how honest<br/>
you are with yourself<br/>
and you<br>
must never<br/>
trade honesty<br/>
for relatability</p>
