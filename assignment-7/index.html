      <h2>ACT I<br/>
      SCENE I. Venice. A street.</h2><br/>
    </p>

        <p><b>Enter ANTONIO, SALARINO, and SALANIO</b></p>

        <p><b>ANTONIO</b><br/>

            In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:<br/>
            It wearies me; you say it wearies you;<br/>
            But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,<br/>
            What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,<br/>
            I am to learn;<br/>
            And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,<br/>
            That I have much ado to know myself.<br/>
          </p>

        <p><b>SALARINO</b><br/>

            Your mind is tossing on the ocean;<br/>
            There, where your argosies with portly sail,<br/>
            Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,<br/>
            Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,<br/>
            Do overpeer the petty traffickers,<br/>
            That curtsy to them, do them reverence,<br/>
            As they fly by them with their woven wings.<br/>
          </p>

        <p><b>SALANIO</b><br/>

            Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,<br/>
            The better part of my affections would<br/>
            Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still<br/>
            Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,<br/>
            Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;<br/>
            And every object that might make me fear<br/>
            Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt<br/>
            Would make me sad.<br/>
          </p>

        <p><b>SALARINO</b><br/>

            My wind cooling my broth<br/>
            Would blow me to an ague, when I thought<br/>
            What harm a wind too great at sea might do.<br/>
            I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,<br/>
            But I should think of shallows and of flats,<br/>
            And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,<br/>
            Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs<br/>
            To kiss her burial. Should I go to church<br/>
            And see the holy edifice of stone,<br/>
            And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,<br/>
            Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,<br/>
            Would scatter all her spices on the stream,<br/>
            Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,<br/>
            And, in a word, but even now worth this,<br/>
            And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought<br/>
            To think on this, and shall I lack the thought<br/>
            That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?<br/>
            But tell not me; I know, Antonio<br/>
            Is sad to think upon his merchandise.<br/>
          </p>

        <p><b>ANTONIO</b><br/>

            Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,<br/>
            My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,<br/>
            Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate<br/>
            Upon the fortune of this present year:<br/>
            Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.<br/>
          </p>

        <p><b>SALARINO</b><br/>

            Why, then you are in love.<br/>
            </p>
