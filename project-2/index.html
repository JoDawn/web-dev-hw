    <div id="instructions">
      <h2>Step 1</h2>
        <p>First, you will need to <b>purchase a blank primed canvas</b>. <br/>
          These are easy to find at any art or craft supply store like <a href="https://michaels.com" target="_blank">Michaels</a>, <a href="https://joann.com" target="_blank">JoAnn Fabrics</a>,
          <a href="https://dickblick.com" target="_blank">Blick Art Materials</a>, or <a href="https://hobbylobby.com" target="_blank">Hobby Lobby</a>. Depending on the size you need, these can cost anywhere from
          $10 to $40. <br/>
          Also, make sure that you like the depth of the canvas and is easy to hang with nails or push-pins.
        </p>
      <h2>Step 2</h2>
        <p>Next you can decide if you want to have <b>two or three colors</b>. You will want to choose colors that match a piece of furniture, fabric or maybe a rug in your home that you love!<br/>
           <b>Lay down your plastic or drop cloth</b> to protect your work area and home.
        </p>
      <h2>Step 3</h2>
        <p>Choose which brush you want to use and have a <b>brush for each color</b> of paint.<br/>
          <b>Pour each color of paint onto a paper plate</b>. This is where you will either dip or roll your brush into.
        </p>
      <h2>Step 4</h2>
        <p><b>Lay down your canvas</b> or prop it up against a wall. Decide if you want to work in a horizontal, vertical or X pattern.
        </p>
      <h2>Step 5</h2>
        <p>Load up your brush with one color and <b>start applying the paint</b>. Remember to NOT mix your paint colors. This may require waiting between layers or colors to dry before moving on to the next.<br/>
          You can decide if and how much of the white canvas you want to be visible in your completed abstract art piece. You can also use the painter's tape to make lines or negative space for added interest.
        </p>
      <h2>Step 6</h2>
        <p>When the paint is still wet, you can decide if you want to add any extra brush strokes to make a smearing effect. Or maybe you want some paint dripping? Just add some water to mix into your paint until it is fluid enough to get the effect you want.
          To add these effects, either lightly wipe the wet globs of paint with a brush or with an extra paper plate. Take a look at the example below with dots and smears. For spray paint to drip, you will need to tilt the canvas in the direction you want the drips to go
          and keep spraying in one spot long enough for it to start dripping.
        </p>
      <h3>Cautions/Notes</h3>
        <p>BE VERY CAREFUL OF FUMES AND YOUR SURROUNDINGS WHEN USING SPRAY PAINT!<br/>
          Many kinds of paint has to be cleaned up and washed when wet for damages and/or stains to be removed.<br/>
          Always work in a well ventilated area when using paint of any kind.<br/>
          Make sure that animals and small children are not exposed to possible toxic fumes.<br/>
          Always read the warning labels on any paint before you open and use them.<br/>
