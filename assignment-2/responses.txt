Data travels on the internet in packets from one computer to another by going
through servers. Servers communicate with each other and share information
that is being requested. The servers work with networks that act as data hubs,
or a kind of junction. I like to think of it like a train station. The data
are people, the tracks/routes are the internet cables, the servers are smaller
sub-stations, the packets are trains, and the networks are the hub-stations
that go in different directions. This may be a bit inaccurate, but it's how
I visualize how the internet works.

The relationship between Internet Protocol address and the Domain Name System
is that they are both used for identifying and finding public information.
An IP address is very unique and specific being assigned with numbers. A DNS
is the location name made up with letters. You type these DNS addresses into
your web browser. They are usually a name of some kind, like the name of a
person or business. IP and DNS addresses are open to the public, but DNS
addresses can be hacked, stolen or falsified with an incorrect IP address.
Both are designed to scale for the usage and future growth of the internet.
