# Notes for class

To preview your code in web page view:
* View> Toggle Command Palette> search: markdown preview: Toggle
* Or go to: Packages> markdown preview> toggle preview

A short cut for that preview is: ^ (which is shfit + 6) then the up arrow then M
Haven't been able to successfully execute the shortcut method
