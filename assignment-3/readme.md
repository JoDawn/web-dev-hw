  <h1>Technical Report</h1>
  <h3>Johanna Johnson</h3>
    <p>An html page must have one head and body element. One of each is all that is needed and necessary for a funtional webpage.
    </p>

    <p>The diffrence between structural and semantic markups are their purpose. Structural markup is like directions and organization. Some examples of structural markup are:
      <ul>
        <li>paragraphs</li>
        <li>headings</li>
        <li>block quotes</li>
        <li>lists</li>
        </ul>
    Semantic markup is for formatting and more specific direction for a certain set of code. Such as:
      <ul>
        <li>making text <b>bold</b>, <i>italic</i>, etc.</li>
        <li>links to other pages</li>
        <li>forms for information</li>
        <li>definitions</li>
    </p>

    <p>My work for this cylce was slow-coming. I got hung up in trying to write the realitve url for the first image. I kept trying different addresses, files and even the actual url to show only the image. I didn't realize until I moved on to the other steps that the link was meant to direct the viewer to the footnote, and not bring up a new window to view a picture that was already being displayed. Again, I was frustrated with trying to understand what was being asked of me and it was simpler than I was making it. As I got further down the steps for the index.html page, I discovered that I really needed to slow down when I read the instructions. It was very clear of what lines to go to, what markup was being requested and what examples were being given. I think I start the steps blindly following the words and then by the end of the assignment I understand what the end result is supposed to be and seeing that represented in the code created. I really liked the examples given with the links with the definitions. I thought that was a very complex compilation of code and it was helpful to have a correct example instead of just asking us to create the links and markups from scratch.
