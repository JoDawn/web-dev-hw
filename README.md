# *My Intro-Web-Dev Homework Repo*
## Johanna Johnson

I have decided to take this class this class because I want to learn how to design a website and understand how it works. So that I have the necessary skills to share and promote myself, as an artist, as well as for the real estate company I work for part-time as a secretary/graphic designer. I feel like this class is extremely relevant to my career goals and is an important aspect of keeping up with technology and understand how to use it.
* I learned that the internet is an actual physical thing.
* It is different from the world wide web.
* It is an efficient way to share information for people in locations far away from each other.
* It has been around way longer than I thought
